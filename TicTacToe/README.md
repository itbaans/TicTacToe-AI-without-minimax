# Tic-Tac-Toe AI with Decentralized Decision Making

## Overview

This project implements a Tic-Tac-Toe AI with a decentralized decision-making method. The AI's logic is inspired by a research paper included in the repository, which describes the decentralized approach to decision-making for board games. The AI is integrated into a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game that can be played on the console using keyboard inputs.

## Decentralized Decision Making

The decentralized decision-making method allows the AI to make decisions based on local board evaluations rather than a centralized evaluation of the entire game state. This approach involves dividing the board into smaller regions and having each region independently evaluate its best move. By doing so, the AI can perform faster and more efficiently, providing a responsive and challenging gameplay experience.

## Features

- Play Tic-Tac-Toe against an intelligent AI.
- Console-based interface for an easy and straightforward gameplay experience.
- Decentralized AI decision-making for improved performance and efficiency.
- Responsive AI that makes quick and intelligent moves based on local evaluations.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a console or terminal window in the project directory.
3. Compile the program (if needed) using the necessary build commands.
4. Run the executable to start the Tic-Tac-Toe game.
5. The game board is represented by a 3x3 grid, and each cell is labeled with a number for input.
6. Players take turns to enter their moves by specifying the cell number they want to place their marker (e.g., 1-9).
7. The game will continue until one of the players wins or the board is filled, resulting in a draw.
8. The AI will make intelligent moves using the decentralized decision-making method, providing a challenging opponent.

## Research Paper

The research paper titled "Decentralized Decision Making in the Game of Tic-tac-toe" is included in the repository. It provides insights into the theoretical foundation and algorithmic details behind the decentralized approach used in this Tic-Tac-Toe AI. It is recommended to read the paper for a deeper understanding of the AI's logic and implementation.

## Limitations

- The Tic-Tac-Toe AI is designed specifically for the 3x3 board, and its effectiveness on larger boards is not guaranteed.
- The console-based interface might lack visual appeal and may not provide graphical feedback during gameplay.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to acknowledge the authors of the research paper for their valuable contribution to the field of decentralized decision-making in board games. This project's implementation was a challenging yet rewarding experience, and I hope it provides an enjoyable gaming experience for users.
